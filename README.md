# group_rings
- the study of the structure of group rings (group algebras);
- the determination when a group ring in serial;
- C++ realization of group rings.

A module *M* is said to be **uniserial**, if its lattice of submodules is a chain; and *M* is **serial** if it is a direct sum of uniserial modules. We say that a ring *R* is **serial**, if the right regular module *R_R* is serial and the same holds true for the left module *_RR*.
